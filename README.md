Apache Fineract: A Platform for Microfinance  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/apache/fineract.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/apache/fineract)  [![Docker Hub](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/apache/fineract.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/fineract)  [![Docker Build](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/build/apache/fineract.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/fineract/builds)
============

Fineract is a mature platform with open APIs that provides a reliable, robust, and affordable core banking solution for financial institutions offering services to the worldâ€™s 2 billion underbanked and unbanked.

[Have a look at the FAQ on our Wiki at apache.org](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/FAQ) if this README does not answer what you are looking for.

[![Code Now! (Gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/apache/fineract)
to start contributing to this project in the online web-based IDE GitPod.io right away!
(You may initially have to press F1 to Find Command and run "Java: Start Language Server".)
It's of course also possible to contribute with a "traditional" local development environment (see below).

Community
=========

If you are interested in contributing to this project, but perhaps don't quite know how and where to get started, please [join our developer mailing list](http://fineract.apache.org/#contribute), listen into our conversations, chime into threads, and just send us a friendly "Hello!" introduction email; we're a friendly bunch, and look forward to hearing from you.


Requirements
============
* Java >= 1.8 (Oracle JVMs have been tested)
* MySQL 5.5
* Tomcat 9, if deploying to a separate servlet container. Until FINERACT-730, Tomcat 7/8 were also supported, but now Tomcat 9 is required. 

You can run the required version of the database server in a container, instead of having to install it, like this:

    docker run --name mysql-5.5 -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql -d mysql:5.5

and stop and destroy it like this:

    docker rm -f mysql-5.5

Beware that this database container database keeps its state inside the container and not on the host filesystem.  It is lost when you destroy (rm) this container.  This is typically fine for development.  See [Caveats: Where to Store Data on the database container documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) re. how to make it persistent instead of ephemeral.


Instructions how to run for local development
============

Run the following commands:
1. `./gradlew createDB -PdbName=fineract_tenants`
1. `./gradlew createDB -PdbName=fineract_default`
1. `./gradlew bootRun`


Instructions to download gradle wrapper
============
The file fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar binary is checked into this projects Git source repository,
but won't exist in your copy of the Fineract codebase if you downloaded a released source archive from apache.org.
In that case, you need to download it using the commands below:

    wget --no-check-certificate -P fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper https://github.com/apache/fineract/raw/develop/fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar

(or)

    curl --insecure -L https://github.com/apache/fineract/raw/develop/fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar > fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar


Instructions to run Apache RAT (Release Audit Tool)
============
1. Extract the archive file to your local directory.
2. Run `./gradlew rat`. A report will be generated under build/reports/rat/rat-report.txt


Instructions to build a WAR file
============
1. Extract the archive file to your local directory.
2. Run `./gradlew clean bootWar` or `./gradlew build` to build a deployable war file which will be created at build/libs directory.


Instructions to execute Integration tests
============
> Note that if this is the first time to access MySQL DB, then you may need to reset your password.

Run the following commands, very similarly to how [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) does:
1. `./gradlew createDB -PdbName=fineract_tenants`
1. `./gradlew createDB -PdbName=fineract_default`
1. `./gradlew clean integrationTest`


Instructions to run using Docker and docker-compose
===================================================

It is possible to do a 'one-touch' installation of Fineract using containers (AKA "Docker").
Fineract now packs the mifos community-app web ui in it's docker deploy.
You can now run and test fineract with it a GUI directly from the combined docker builds.

As Prerequisites, you must have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your machine; see
[Docker Install](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and
[Docker Compose Install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Alternatively, you can also use [Podman](https://github.com/containers/libpod)
(e.g. via `dnf install podman-docker`), and [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose/)
(e.g. via `pip3 install podman-compose`) instead of Docker.

Now to run a new Fineract instance you can simply:

1. `git clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git ; cd fineract`
1. `docker-compose build`
1. `docker-compose up -d`
1. fineract (back-end) is running at https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/
1. wait for https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/actuator/health to return `{"status":"UP"}`
1. you must go to https://localhost:8443 and remember to accept the self-signed SSL certificate of the API once in your browser, otherwise  you get a message that is rather misleading from the UI.
1. community-app (UI) is running at http://localhost:9090/?baseApiUrl=https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider&tenantIdentifier=default
1. login using default _username_ `mifos` and _password_ `password`

The [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) will build the `fineract` container from the source based on the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile).

https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/fineract has a pre-built container of this project, built continuously.

You must specify the MySQL tenants database JDBC URL by passing it to the `fineract` container via environment
variables; please consult the [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) for exact details how to specify those.
_(Note that in previous versions, the `mysqlserver` environment variable used at `docker build` time instead of at
`docker run` time did something similar; this has changed in [FINERACT-773](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-773)),
and the `mysqlserver` environment variable is now no longer supported.)_


Instructions to run on Kubernetes
=================================

General Clusters
----------------

You can also run Fineract using containers on a Kubernetes cluster.
Make sure you set up and connect to your Kubernetes cluster.
You can follow [this](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Install+and+configure+kubectl+and+Google+Cloud+SDK+on+ubuntu+16.04) guide to set up a Kubernetes cluster on GKE. Make sure to replace `apache-fineract-cn` with `apache-fineract`

Now e.g. from your Google Cloud shell, run the following commands:

1. `git clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git ; cd fineract/kubernetes`
1. `./kubectl-startup`

To shutdown and reset your Cluster, run:

    ./kubectl-shutdown

Using Minikube
--------------

Alternatively, you can run fineract on a local kubernetes cluster using [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/).
As Prerequisites, you must have `minikube` and `kubectl` installed on your machine; see
[Minikube & Kubectl install](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).

Now to run a new Fineract instance on Minikube you can simply:

1. `git clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git ; cd fineract/kubernetes`
1. `minikube start`
1. `./kubectl-startup.sh`
1. `minikube service fineract-server --url --https`
1. Fineract is now running at the printed URL (note HTTP), which you can check e.g. using:

    http --verify=no --timeout 240 --check-status get $(minikube service fineract-server --url --https)/fineract-provider/actuator/health

To check the status of your containers on your local minikube Kubernetes cluster, run:

    minikube dashboard

You can check Fineract logs using:

    kubectl logs deployment/fineract-server

To shutdown and reset your cluster, run:

    ./kubectl-shutdown

We have [some open issues in JIRA with Kubernetes related enhancement ideas](https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-783?jql=labels%20%3D%20kubernetes%20AND%20project%20%3D%20%22Apache%20Fineract%22%20) which you are welcome to contribute to.


Checkstyle
============

This project enforces its code conventions using [checkstyle.xml](fineract-provider/config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml).  It is configured to run automatically during the normal Gradle build, and fail if there are any style violations detected.
We recommend that you configure your favourite Java IDE to match those conventions.  For Eclipse, you can
File > Import > General > Preferences our [config/fineractdev-eclipse-preferences.epf](config/fineractdev-eclipse-preferences.epf).
You could also use Checkstyle directly in your IDE (but you don't neccesarily have to, it may just be more convenient for you).  For Eclipse, use https://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs/ and load our checkstyle.xml into it, for IntelliJ you can use [CheckStyle-IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1065-checkstyle-idea).

Code Coverage Reports
============

The project uses Jacoco to measure unit tests code coverage, to generate a report run the following command:

    `./gradlew clean build jacocoTestReport`

Generated reports can be found in build/code-coverage directory.

Pull Requests
-------------

If your PR is failing to pass our CI build due to a test failure, then:

1. Understand if the failure is due to your PR or an unrelated unstable test.
1. If you suspect it is because of a "flaky" test, and not due to a change in your PR, then please do not simply wait for an active maintainer to come and help you, but instead be a proactive contributor to the project - see next steps.
1. Search for the name of the failed test on https://issues.apache.org/jira/, e.g. for `AccountingScenarioIntegrationTest` you would find [FINERACT-899](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-899).
1. If you happen to read in such bugs that tests were just recently fixed, or ignored, then rebase your PR to pick up that change.
1. If you find previous comments "proving" that the same test has arbitrarily failed in at least 3 past PRs, then please do yourself raise a small separate new PR proposing to add an `@Ignore // TODO FINERACT-123` to the respective unstable test (e.g. [#774](https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/774)) with the commit message mentioning said JIRA, as always.  (Please do NOT just `@Ignore` any existing tests mixed in as part of your larger PR.)
1. If there is no existing JIRA for the test, then first please evaluate whether the failure couldn't be a (perhaps strange) impact of the change you are proposing after all.  If it's not, then please raise a new JIRA to document the suspected Flaky Test, and link it to [FINERACT-850](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-850).  This will allow the next person coming along hitting the same test failure to easily find it, and eventually propose to ignore the unstable test.
1. Then (only) Close and Reopen your PR, which will cause a new build, to see if it passes.
1. Of course, we very much appreciate you then jumping onto any such bugs and helping us figure out how to fix all ignored tests!

[Pull Request Size Limit](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Pull+Request+Size+Limit)
documents that we cannot accept huge "code dump" Pull Requests, with some related suggestions.

Guideline for new Feature commits involving Refactoring: If you are submitting PR for a new Feature,
and it involves refactoring, try to differentiate "new Feature code" with "Refactored" by placing
them in different commits. This helps review to review your code faster.


Releasing
---------

[How to Release Apache Fineract](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/DRwIB) documents the process how we make the source code that is available here in this Git repository into a binary release ZIP available on http://fineract.apache.org.
